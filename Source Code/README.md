# Making a Discord "App"
Before we start coding, we need to make a discord app using the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
You need to create a discord app by pressing "new application" and then adding a bot to that application.

## Client ID and Bot Token
Our application will contain a unique **client ID** which we will need when creating the bot, as the name suggestes it will identify our client application as a client application.
This is so discord's servers know that our client is for our program and not one of their app clients such as the one used by the discord application itself.
**The bot token** is used to identify the bot. Every bot has its own token, this token should never be revealed to anyone except the bot's developers.
